# Simple-To-Do-list-App
I have created a Simple To-Do list web application which can help to organize tasks.
This web app includes 3 features:
1.Add Tasks
2.Delete Tasks
3.Mark Tasks as completed

Here I have used local storage of browser to store data . If you refresh the web page the data will not be disappeared. Even if you delete the tab and restore it again, the data will be not disappeared.
